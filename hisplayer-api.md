## Functions
The following functions are provided by **HISPlayerManager**. They are **not public** so it’s necessary to create a custom script which inherits from **HISPlayerManager**.

### Virtual functions
These functions can be overridden.
#### protected virtual void Awake()
MonoBehaviour function which will be called from the beginning of the scene. It can be overridden but to make the system work it’s necessary to call base.Awake() into the overridden function.
